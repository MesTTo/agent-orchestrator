// aggregatedEventNames are the event names prone to bursts (crash loops,
// retry storms) that get folded into one rollup event per minute instead of
// one PostHog event per occurrence, and correspondingly get the generous
// daily rate-limit tier since their per-occurrence cost is already gone (see
// RateLimitedSink's eventsPerNamePerDayAggregated). Must match the event
// names as actually emitted (see httpd/router.go and httpd/recover.go /
// httpd/log.go) exactly, including underscores - there is no compile-time
// check tying this list to the emit sites.
//
// Deliberately does NOT include ao.cli.invoked or ao.app.active: those are
// already deduped to at most once per command-path/day (ao.cli.invoked) or
// once per day (ao.app.active) at the httpd layer before they ever reach a
// sink, including for ao hooks/ao pty-host and high-frequency polling
// commands like ao status/ao session ls - adding them here would double up
// on dedup logic that already owns that job and gains nothing.
